# simple-math-lib

This is the behind-the-scenes functionality of `simple-math`.  
It was split into a separate crate recently.

This is not (yet) on crates.io, nor does it have any versioning.  
This is due to the usual constantly changing nature of my applications,  
so it's probably best to keep to the latest version.

Include it in your project with
```
simple_math_lib = { git = "https://github.com/jD91mZM2/simple-math" }
```
